# Discord Dashboard Bot

## About Me

Hello! I’m Mehmet Enes Tiske, a third-year Computer Engineering student at Gazi University. I have a strong passion for developing innovative software solutions and honing my skills in full-stack development. My goal is to create applications that not only solve real-world problems but also enhance user experiences. This project represents my efforts to integrate various technologies while building a functional and engaging tool for Discord users.

## Project Overview

The Discord Dashboard Bot is designed to streamline server management for Discord communities, offering a robust set of features that can be accessed via both Discord commands and a web dashboard. The aim of this project is to empower server administrators and users by providing a comprehensive toolset for enhancing community engagement and simplifying administrative tasks. The bot integrates several functionalities, including automated message handling, user subscriptions, profile management, and a fully functional economy system, all contributing to a dynamic server environment.

## Key Features
  
  ### Server Management
  The bot offers extensive server management capabilities, allowing administrators to efficiently control various server aspects. From creating and managing repeating messages to monitoring user subscriptions, every feature is designed to enhance the administrative experience and promote server engagement.
  
  ### Automated Interactions
  One of the standout features is the automated repeating messages functionality. Admins can set up messages that will be sent at specified intervals, keeping server members informed about important announcements or events without requiring manual input. This feature is particularly useful for maintaining engagement and ensuring that key information reaches users consistently.
  
  ### Subscription Services
  With a built-in subscription management system, users can easily subscribe to special features or content. The bot allows for seamless creation, deletion, and modification of subscriptions, ensuring that members can access exclusive perks. This functionality not only adds value to the user experience but also helps create a sense of community through shared benefits.
  
  ### Profile Customization
  Users can personalize their profiles within the server, making it more engaging and reflective of their personalities. Features such as customizable profile backgrounds, progress bars, and personal messages allow users to express themselves and stand out in the community. This level of customization enhances user interaction and fosters a more connected community.
  
  ### Leaderboards and Rewards
  The bot includes a comprehensive leaderboard system that tracks user progress and engagement. Admins can reward users with XP and assign roles based on their achievements, encouraging participation and fostering healthy competition within the server. This gamification element is a great way to motivate users and enhance their experience.
  
  ### Giveaway Management
  Organizing giveaways is made easy with the bot’s dedicated commands. Admins can create, modify, and delete giveaways through both Discord commands and the web dashboard, making it simple to run events that encourage user interaction and excitement. The bot also allows for detailed tracking of giveaway participants and outcomes, ensuring transparency and fairness.
  
  ### Integrated Shop System
  The bot features a virtual shop where users can buy and sell items using in-server currency. This economic system adds an additional layer of engagement, allowing users to interact with one another and the server in new ways. Admins can manage shop items, set prices, and track transactions through an intuitive interface.

## Web Dashboard Integration

To complement the Discord bot, a web dashboard is provided for a more streamlined management experience. This dashboard allows administrators to manage various tasks easily, including giveaway organization, user profile adjustments, shop item management, and viewing payment histories for transactions processed through Stripe. The web interface enhances usability and provides a comprehensive overview of server activities.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, EJS – For building the web dashboard interface and ensuring a responsive user experience.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Discord.js – To power the bot's functionalities and handle server requests efficiently.
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe – For managing user subscriptions and handling financial transactions securely.

## Future Enhancements

As I continue to develop this project, I plan to implement additional features, including:
- Enhanced analytics for server engagement and user activity.
- More customization options for user profiles and dashboards.
- Integration with additional APIs for richer content and functionality.
- Improved error handling and user feedback mechanisms for commands.
